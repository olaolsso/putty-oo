# putty-oo

Putty-oo is a minor modification of the Windows version of [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) which includes a [URL patch](http://ryara.net/putty-url/).

In addition, putty-oo saves the position of its window when settings are saved and modifies the function and cursor keys under xterm so that they make sense.
